          Borrow responsibly We encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and
          federal student loans to pay for college. Students and families should evaluate all anticipated monthly
          loan payments, and how much the student expects to earn in the future, before considering a private student
          loan.

        <p>1 Although we do not charge a penalty or fee if you prepay your loan, any prepayment will be applied
          as outlined in your promissory noteâ€”first to Unpaid Fees and costs, then to Unpaid Interest, and then to
          Current Principal.</p>
